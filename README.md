# Research Q&A Assistant

An interactive web application that allows users to upload their own research papers (PDF) or load multiple research articles from arXiv. Users can then ask detailed, technical questions about the loaded papers. The app uses Google’s Gemini AI via LangChain for advanced language understanding and summarization.

## Features

- Load research papers by entering arXiv IDs (supports multiple IDs, comma-separated)
- Upload your own PDF research paper
- Automatically summarize loaded papers for quick insights
- Ask detailed questions about the loaded research content
- Maintains chat history for a conversational experience
- Clear chat history without losing loaded papers
- Simple, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit
